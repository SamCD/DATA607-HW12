RDBMS vs NoSQL

RDBMS systems are ideal for storing tabular data structures with simple relationships, such as financial data. NoSQL is ideal for complex, multi-layered, heirarchical data, for example geo-spatial data. It is also better at managing data models that change as time goes on, providing more flexibility.
